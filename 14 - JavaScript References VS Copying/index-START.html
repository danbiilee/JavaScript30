    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);
    //team[0] = 'danbi';

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    console.clear();

    const team2 = players.slice(0);
    team2[0] = 'danbi';
    console.log(players, team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[1] = 'danbi';
    
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[2] = 'danbi';
    console.log(players, team4);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    console.clear();
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const me = person;
    console.log(person, me);
    //me.age = 100;


    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const me2 = Object.assign({}, person, {plus: 'plus'});
    me2.age = 100;
    console.log(person, me2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const me3 = {...person};
    me3.age = 1000000;
    console.log(person, me3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const test = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      addr: {
        country: 'Korea',
        city: 'Seoul'
      }
    };

    const me4 = {...test};
    //me4.addr.country = 'USA'

    const me5 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(test));
    me5.addr.country = 'USA'
